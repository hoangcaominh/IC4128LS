Known issues:
- When starting a replay, if at the start of the stage the motivation percentage is lower than 150% then the the miss counter will increase by 1. This is because the motivation is set to 200% for a very brief moment before being changed to a different value based on the replay file and the program misunderstands that as a miss.
- Sometimes the program will not read the game's memory when it is in fullscreen mode. This is an unknown problem that comes from the Windows operating system. To fix the problem, try alt-tabbing the game or closing and reopening the program. Especially for participants, ALWAYS check if the program is running before starting a new run.
